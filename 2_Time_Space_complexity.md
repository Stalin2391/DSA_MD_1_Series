## Basics of logs:

#### What is log ? 
Inverse of Exponential function.
The logarithm of \( a \) to the base \( b \) is expressed as:

# Logarithm and Exponentiation

We can represent logarithms as:

$$ \log_b(a) $$

This asks: *What value do you need to raise \( b \) to in order to get \( a \)?*

---

### Example 1

‚ùì **Q1**: What is \( \log_2(64) \)?  
*In other words, what value must we raise 2 to in order to get 64?*

$$ \log_2(64) $$

We know that:

$$ 2^6 = 64 $$

So, the answer is:

$$ \log_2(64) = 6 $$

---

### Summary

- \( \log_b(a) = x \) means that \( b^x = a \).
- In this case, for \( \log_2(64) \), we found that \( x = 6 \) because \( 2^6 = 64 \).
