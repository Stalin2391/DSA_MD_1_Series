## Basics of logs:

#### What is log ? 
Inverse of Exponential function.
The logarithm of \( a \) to the base \( b \) is expressed as:

# Logarithm and Exponentiation

We can represent logarithms as:

$$ \log_b(a) $$

This asks: *What value do you need to raise \( b \) to in order to get \( a \)?*

---
## Perfect Square:
### ❓Question 1
*In other words, what value must we raise 2 to in order to get 64?*

$$ \log_2(64) $$

We know that:

$$ 2^6 = 64 $$

So, the answer is:

$$ \log_2(64) = 6 $$

### ❓Question 2
*In other words, what value must we raise 5 to in order to get 25?*

$$ \log_5(25) $$

We know that:

$$ 5^2 = 25 $$

So, the answer is:

$$ \log_5(25) = 2 $$

### ❓Question 3
*In other words, what value must we raise 2 to in order to get 32?*

$$ \log_2(32) $$

We know that:

$$ 2^5 = 32 $$

So, the answer is:

$$ \log_2(32) = 5 $$

## Not a Perfect Square than take floor Value

### ❓Question 4

$$ \log_2(10) $$


$$ 2^3 = 10 $$

So, the answer is:

$$ \log_2(10) = 3 $$
